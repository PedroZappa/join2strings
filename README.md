# README: A Simple String Concatenation Program

This repository contains a C program called `join2strings.c` that concatenates two strings and displays the concatenated result. The program is a simple demonstration of string manipulation in C.

## Getting Started

To get started with this program, you can clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/join2strings-c.git
```

Next, navigate to the directory containing the `join2strings.c` file and compile the program using a C compiler such as `gcc`:

```bash
gcc join2strings.c -o join2strings
```

This will generate an executable file named `join2strings` that you can run.

## Usage

To run the program, simply execute the `join2strings` file in your terminal:

```bash
./join2strings
```

Upon running the program, it will display the concatenated result of the two predefined strings:

```

Please note that the strings being concatenated are hardcoded in the program. If you want to concatenate different strings, you can modify the `s1` and `s2` variables in the source code and recompile the program.
